                <label for="checklist5">Start trying to schedule a date and time with your venue, caterer, wedding coordinator/planner, and any other key vendors that you'd like to include for a "Final Walkthrough" meeting at your venue. 
                    It's best to plan for this meeting to actually occur between 2-1 months prior to your wedding date and is intended as a collaborative effort with your key vendors to tie up any loose ends in-person. 
                    Not all vendors or venues may offer this service, and it will likely take a bit of coordinating to find a time that will work for all parties, but if you can find a time to make this meeting happen, it will really expedite 
                    your final planning process. Keep in mind that most caterers and venues will require this meeting to happen during business hours, not on evenings or weekends.</label><br>

                    could help give examples and advice about a suggested order and timing of your preferred activities.</label><br>
