# IDoToDos
As a former luxury wedding planner, I often found myself wishing I could refer my clients to an easy-to-use digital wedding planning checklist that didn’t require couples to download an entirely separate (and more generalized) wedding app for access. I always wished for something that was strictly checklist-related, with options for customization on an event’s specific task items but with a thorough overall “to-do” list that would cover the basic planning tasks necessary for all levels of wedding planning clients, from my “full-planning” clients who didn’t manage their own event to-do list whatsoever to my “month-of coordination” clients who were largely planning everything on their own. While there are TONS of wedding websites/apps that offer some version of a wedding “to-do” list as a part of their overall wedding planning assistance (along with RSVP management and wedding website creation and seating chart set-up and so on), I always wanted something to refer couples to solely for the checklist, as sometimes all the extra bells and whistles were more overwhelming than helpful.

Thus the idea for “I Do To-Dos” was born (about 3 years late and for my entirely unrelated Code:You Capstone Project, but still). My plan is to create a website where users input their wedding date on the home page, and a month-by-month wedding planning checklist specific to their unique wedding date populates afterwards. The checklist will be best suited for users accessing this checklist at the beginning of their wedding planning timeline, and most “ideally” with a one-year overall lead time in mind, but if clients input a date that would condense their planning timeline to shorter than one year, the website will allow them to check off tasks they’ve already accomplished to hide any completed tasks and only display their remaining to-dos. Clients would also have the option of inputting additional to-do items as needed for their specific event. I will integrate the ability to print the checklist with the accurate months and tasks for the specific wedding date at the bottom of the checklist. 

Further development (not possible for this current iteration of the project but just a more fleshed out imagination of the site) would include the ability for users to log-in and save their wedding date/already checked off items, so they would not have to check off already completed items each time they logged in.

3.	Responsive Design Tools & Technologies: I will use HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries), JavaScript, Google Calendar API, & Node.js.
a.	I will use media queries, CSS Grid and Flexbox, and responsive components to create an adaptable website/lay-out that provides a cohesive user experience across different devices.
b.	I will integrate Google Calendar API into my website to tailor the specific outline of the wedding to-do checklist based on the user’s unique wedding date and time span leading up to said date.

4.	Feature Implementation: I will integrate many different features within my project, including but not limited to: 
•	Feature 1A—Using arrays, objects, & sets to store and retrieve information that will be displayed in my app: for the many wedding to-do tasks that will need to populate based on each unique wedding date)
•	Feature 1C—Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved): for the actual input of the user’s wedding date on the home page
•	Feature 1D—Analyze text and display useful information about it. (e.g. word/character count in an input field): to generate the correct month-by-month checklist specific to the user’s specific wedding date
•	Feature 1F—Visualize data in a user friendly way: creating the checklist to look organized & well-separated by monthly tasks, literally able to “check-off” (whether in app or printed)
•	Feature 1I—By integrating a Google Calendar API, calculate and display data based on an external factor: display the checklist based on how many days/months are remaining until the user’s wedding date
•	Feature 2A—By integrating a Google Calendar API, retrieve data from said API and use it to display something within my app: for display of the months remaining until wedding day and the specific tasks delineated per month leading up to that date
•	Feature 3C—Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc): for the actual wedding date input on home page
